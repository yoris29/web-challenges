# 🚀 Web Journey Project: **CollabNote**

> **Build a real-time collaborative note management app through progressive challenges and workshop sessions**

Welcome to **CollabNote** - your journey to building a complete full-stack web application! This is where theory meets practice as you create a real-time, collaborative note management platform that teams can use to create, share, and collaborate on notes together.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview: CollabNote

**CollabNote** is a full-stack web application that allows users to:

* ✍️ **Create personal or shared notes** with rich-text editing
* 🤝 **Collaborate with others in real-time** on shared documents
* 💬 **Comment and discuss** directly on notes
* 🏷️ **Organize with tags** and powerful filtering options
* 📁 **Upload images** and manage file attachments
* 🔄 **Experience live updates** as collaborators make changes

### 🌟 Why CollabNote?

This project follows a **session-driven development approach** where:

- 📚 **Workshop sessions** introduce new concepts and technologies
- 🎯 **Challenges** help you apply those concepts to build CollabNote features
- 🔄 **Progressive building** - each feature builds upon previous work
- 🤝 **Community learning** - share solutions and learn from others

By the end of this journey, you'll have built a **production-ready collaborative platform** that you can proudly showcase!
